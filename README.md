###### matbuttons is a simple matlab script for creating gui elements and especially buttons in arbitary sizes and shapes.

Unfortunately despite the many incarnations of mathworks's ui building (Guide and its children, including some exceptional commits from file-exchange), its functionality leaves something to be desired. A prominent exclusion -at least to me, is the absence of circle buttons*.

*Geps_summer_treat* is a small demo script that serves as a guide for creating buttons with practically no creative limitations at the price of exposing some java functionality by undocumented methods and reqires a little bit of photoshop/gimp skills. 

See **manual.pdf** for a quick overview and run Geps_summer_treat.m for inspecting the different flavors.
